    <h2 class = "welcome show-on-scroll"> &#128522; Hi, I'm Dan, a versatile engineering graduate</h2>
    <p>
      I am graduating this fall from the University of Waterloo with a
      degree in civil engineering. &#127891; I have a well-rounded education and a diverse
      background including internships in engineering consulting, project
      management, and software development. &#128187;

    <h2 style = "margin-top: 10%;"> Athletics & Commitment</h2>
    <p>
      At university, I am a
      <a href = "https://athletics.uwaterloo.ca/sports/mens-tennis/roster/jie-dan-tan-shi/6238">
        student athlete</a> playing tennis, &#127934; a sport that I have loved and
        dedicated since the age of 10. I became an officially certified coach in 2018.

    <h2> Entrepreneurship </h2>
    <p>
      In 2018, my team and I pitched our idea of creating an online handicraft
      platform - Craft Collective at
      <a href = "https://uwaterloo.ca/conrad-school-entrepreneurship-business/news/student-entrepreneurs-pitch-solutions-youth-unemployment">
         Hult Prize,</a>&#127941; &#127908; the largest social entrepreneurship challenge.
          Our detailed business model and user analysis helped us advance to the final round on campus.

    <h2> Leadership </h2>
    <p>
      I was part of the podcast crew &#127897; at <a href = "https://anchor.fm/uwaterlooewb">
        Ideas Without Borders</a>, an EWB initiative during the summer of 2018 advocating systems thinking
        not only for engineers, but for university students at large.
        During my co-op in China, I also volunteered as an English Teacher at
        <a href = " https://steppingstoneschina.net "> Stepping Stones</a>, teaching
        migrant Chinese students English.

    <h2> Foreign Exchange & Travel </h2>
    <p>
      I travel extensively around the world &#9968; &#128333; with 21 on the list currently, many
      of which took place during my exchange in the UK. Crazy or not, here is a fun story:
      <a href = " https://emmaus.org.uk/leeds/students-complete-jailbreak-hitch-for-emmaus-leeds/">
        I hitchhiked from Leeds, UK to Cologne, Germany under 48 hrs &#9203; for a charity.</a>.
