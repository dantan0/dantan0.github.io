    <h2> Entrepreneurship </h2>
    <p>
      I had no business background, but I wanted to explore entrepreneurship
      and turn ideas &#128161; into actions. So I did.
      I and my team pitched &#127908; our idea of creating an online handicraft
      platform - Craft Collective at the
      <a href = "https://uwaterloo.ca/conrad-school-entrepreneurship-business/news/student-entrepreneurs-pitch-solutions-youth-unemployment">
         2019 Hult Prize.</a>&#127941;
          Our detailed business model &#128202; and user analysis helped us advance to the final round on campus,
          beating 20+ teams along the way.

    <h2> Commitment </h2>
    <p>
      I am a student athlete <a href = "https://athletics.uwaterloo.ca/sports/mens-tennis/roster/jie-dan-tan-shi/6238">
      </a> playing tennis &#127934;, a sport that I've dedicated since the age of 10. Every tennis match and every run &#127939; is a challenge,
      but I enjoy it. Go Warriors! &#128170; In 2018, I became an officially certified tennis coach, a dream come true.

    <h2> Leadership </h2>
    <p>
      Social good means a lot to me. I joined the podcast crew &#127897; at
      <a href = "https://anchor.fm/uwaterlooewb"> Ideas Without Borders</a>,
      an EWB initiative during the summer of 2018 advocating systems thinking
        &#129300; not only for engineers, but for university students at large.
        During my co-op in China, I volunteered as an English Teacher at
        <a href = " https://steppingstoneschina.net "> Stepping Stones</a>, teaching
        migrant Chinese students English.

    <h2> Academic Exchange </h2>
    <p>
      I am adventurous. I travel around the world &#9968; &#128333; (often solo)
      with 21 on the list currently, many of which took place during my exchange
      in the UK. Crazy or not, I hitchhiked from Leeds, UK to Cologne, Germany
      within 36 hrs &#9203; for a
